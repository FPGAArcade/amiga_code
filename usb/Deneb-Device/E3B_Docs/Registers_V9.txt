DENEB Zorro III register description
====================================

DENEB base address is always set on A[31:24], yielding into a 16MB card space.

DENEB is divided into several logical sections; they are selected by address bits A[23:20] only.
Not all sections are in use at the moment.

A[23:20]   section

0x0        register space
0x1        USB host controller
0x2        clockport
0x3        debug SRAM

Section 0x0: register space
===========================

This section contains all registers needed for operation of DENEB USB part.
Registers are selected by address bits A[19:16].

0x0: DMAM register
read only

D[31:18]: DMA length
D[17]   : DMA IRQ
D[16]   : DMA done bit; 1 = done
D[15:0] : DMA target address inside ISP1760

0x1: DMAC register
read / write 

D[31:2] : DMA target address on Zorro 
D[1]    : DMA direction (0 = write, 1 = read)
D[0]    : DMA start, autoreset by DMA_DONE to zero

0x2: DMC register
read / write

D[31:24] : DMA gap
D[23:16] : DMA block size
D[15:1]  : reserved
D[0]     : Buster 11 bit (0 = Buster 9 fix, 1 = Buster 11)

DMA gap: number of E7M cycles between unregistering and registering.
         Real number of cycles = D[31:24] * 4 + 3

DMA block size: number of bus accesses in a block.
                Real number of accesses = D[23:16] + 1

Buster bit: set to zero for Buster 9 fix (fake interrupt, /FCS handling);
            set to one for Buster 11 

0xc: DMI register
read / write

D[31:2] : reserved
D[1]    : IRQ status from ISP1760
D[0]    : IRQ status from DMA state machine

0xd: clockport control register
read / write

D[31]   : clockport status bit from hardware, read only

0xe: USB control register
read / write

0xf: test register, do not use
read / write

Section 0x1: USB host controller
================================

Here are all registers from ISP1760 USB host controller accessible.
There's one important register: the offset 0x33c register is shadowed inside the FPGA.

The SHADOW registers is only activated on bank 3 selection inside the ISP1760.
It is used to set the DMA length and DMA offset inside the ISP1760.
