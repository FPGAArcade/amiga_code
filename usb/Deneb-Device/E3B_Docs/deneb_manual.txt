Deneb prototype manual
======================

General description
-------------------

The Deneb prototype card is built around a Xilinx Coolrunner XCR3256XL CPLD.
It manages all PIO and DMA accesses. Some registers are implemented there, needed for 
operation of the USB card.

Deneb will autoconfigure as one Zorro III card (containing the ISP1760 USB2 host controller),
and one Zorro II card (containing the FlashROM). Only Zorro III is supported in this version,
do not use this card in plain Zorro II backplanes.

Manufacturer ID is 0x0e3b, product ID is 16 decimal for the USB card, and 2 decimal for the
FlashROM card. 

FlashROM can be deactivated by putting a jumper on the pinheader below the ICS512M clock chip.

Memory layout
-------------

The ISP1760 is mapped on 32bit addresses, which allows 1:1 mapping of all addresses given in the 
datasheet.

Registers
---------

There are four CPLD registers implemented, with one register being shadowed in the
CPLD. Addresses are relative to the base address of the Deneb USB card.

CPLD_CTRL: offset 0x030200, read / write
****************************************

Only bits D[31:24] are implemented. 

D31: read only, 0 = DMA not active, 1 = DMA active
D30: 0 = disable external sync, 1 = enable external sync
D29: reserved
D28: 0 = accept regrants, 1 = reject regrants
D27: 0 = Buster 11 mode, 1 = Buster 9 mode
D26: 0 = USB normal operation, 1 = hard reset for ISP1760
D25: 0 = INT disable, 1 = INT enable
D24: 0 = /INT6, 1 = /INT2

Bit 31 reflects the DMA state machine; DMA is running if this bit is set to 1.

Bit 30 allows to synchronize /BRn to accesses on 0xe80000 - 0xefffff Zorro II space.
       Deneb will register with Buster if /DREQ of ISP1760 is set. Set this bit to 1
	   to wait for the /BRn pulse until one Zorro II access to address range 0xe80000 - 0xefffff
	   is done. Synchronisation is only done for registering, not unregistering.
	   Useful for debugging, most useful with Buster9 mode.
	   
Bit 28 sets regrant mechanism: if set to 0, Deneb will accept regrants from Buster. This will
       lead to fast DMA, but the resulting bus grant may hold for the whole DMA transmission.
	   If set to 1, Deneb will unregister with Buster on the reschedule phase (usually after
	   eight /FCS assertations) and register again after four E7M clock cycles.
	   With this bit set DMA transactions will be slow.
	   Useful for debugging.

Bit 27 sets Buster 9 compatibility mode (not severely tested). Best used in conjunction with
       bit 30 to make sure that /BRn pulse will be covered by /FCS and /CCS asserted.
	   
Bit 26 is hard reset for ISP1760. Sequence is 0 - 1 - 0.

Bit 25 switched interrupt generation to Zorro III on and off.

Bit 24 selects the Zorro III interrupt used.

CPLD_REV: offset 0x030204, readonly
***********************************

Only bits D[31:24] are implemented.

CPLD version can be read here. 

CPLD_DMAADDR: offset 0x010200, write only
*****************************************

DMA target address for Zorro III DMA is stored here. This register can only be written.
The full 32bit address range is supported, with A[1:0] being set to zero during DMA cycles
(only longword transfers). Address is autoincremented after each DMA cycle.
There is no DMA length counter in Deneb, DMA is only based on /DREQ from ISP1760 and its internal
DMA engine.

ISP_DMACONFIG: offset 0x0X0330, read / write
********************************************

This register is a shadow register to ISP1760 one. It will be written at the same time as the 
ISP1760 one, and will only store the DMA direction bit from the ISP1760.

Hardware initialization
-----------------------

Recommended setup:

- set reset bit of CPLD_CTRL to one
- wait 30 us
- set reset bit of CPLD_CTRL to zero
- wait 100us
- write ISP_HWMODE with 0x00000141 (32bit data path, level interrupt, polarity low active).
- go ahead

DMA machine handling
--------------------

Recommended setup for DMA start:

- check for running DMA in D31 of CPLD_CTRL
- write DMASTARTADDR in ISP1760
- write CPLD_DMAADDR with target address
- write DMACONFIG in ISP1760 with DMA enable bit set
- if synchronizing, read one word from FlashROM card in Zorro II I/O space
- wait for DMA to finish

Caveats
-------

(Buster) Buster 9 operation is not tested in full depth yet.

(Buster) Buster 11 may fail with two Zorro III bus masters (A4091 or Fastlane).
         Bus lockup may occur in this constellation (seen with A4091 up to now).
		 
(ISP1760) Do not used DMA burst mode. There seems to be a bug in ISP1760 DMA engine, only
          occuring under certain conditions during DMA burst write. Complete lockup of ISP1760
		  will be the consequence. DMA single cycle mode is the better choice here.
