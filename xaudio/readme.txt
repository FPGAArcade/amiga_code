replay.audio 0.1ß - somewhere between proof-of-concept and early alpha state

This driver is purely a simple wrapper over the Replay's xaudio 16bit stereo audio-out sink.
It will not try to do any conversion so it must be used with AHI in stereo-only (no hifi) mode.
And I'm sure there are more than a couple of bugs in there too ;)
